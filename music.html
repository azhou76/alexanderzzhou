                    <h1>Percussion Biography</h1>

                    <p>I began my music journey at age six (2009), first as a pianist and now as a percussionist. I have been selected as 1st Chair percussion for both the Missouri All-State Band (2019) and Missouri All-State Orchestra (2020), during which I performed as a soloist on marimba, and have held the principal position in the St. Louis All-Suburban Band from 2018-2020. In 2020, I was also selected as a member of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra (SLSYO) after having my audition recording reviewed by members of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. In addition, I have won second place in all three categories (Solo Marimba, Solo Timpani, and Duet) at the Mid-Missouri Percussion Arts Trophy (MMPAT) competition, having been adjudicated by renowned percussionists from around the world in Gwendolyn Dease, Svet Stoyanov, and James Doyle.</p>

                    <p>I have also been able to perform with a variety of ensembles throughout the years. Outside of my experiences playing in the Missouri All-State Band/Orchestra, St. Louis All-Suburban Band, and SLSYO, I have had the opportunity to perform in the St. Charles Community College Choir, Indiana University Summer Percussion Academy Ensemble, and Interlochen Summer Percussion Institute Ensemble. For the past three years, I have played as part of the Ladue Horton Watkins High School (LHWHS) Symphonic Band, which was selected to perform at the Missouri Music Educators Association (MMEA) Conference in 2019. Furthermore, I have performed with the LHWHS Chamber Orchestra and the LHWHS Percussion Ensemble as the Section Leader alongside numerous local professionals, including Tom Stubbs and John Kasica (both current or retired St. Louis Symphony Orchestra percussionists) in 2019.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank my family and teachers, including Michael Faris, Erin Elstner, Kevin Gianino, Matt Henry, Alan Stewart, Aaron Lehde, Jason Harris, Scott Harris, Betsy Cytron, and Katie Solomon, for their continued support throughout the years and for allowing me to grow not only as a musician but also as a young man.</p>

                    <h1>Piano Biography</h1>

                    <p>As I stated earlier, before I became a percussionist, I was first a pianist. I played piano for a total of 8 years, beginning in 2009 and deciding to focus full-time on percussion in 2018, first joining the competitve scene in 2012. Each year from 2012 through 2017, I qualified past the Missouri Music Teachers Association (MMTA) District Competition and reached the State Competition as a soloist. At the State Competition, I placed 3rd in 2012, 2013, and 2014. I also competed as part of a duet team, beginning in 2014, and in all three years my partner and I competed (2014, 2015, 2017), we qualified for the State Competition, earning 2nd place each time.</p>

                    <p>I have also been able to perform with the St. Louis All-Suburban Band in 2018 as well as the LHWHS Band on multiple occasions, including during our performance at the MMEA convention in 2019.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank my family and my teacher Laura Schindler.</p>
