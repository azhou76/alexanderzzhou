                    <h1>Percussion Biography</h1>

                    <p>I began my music journey at age six (2009), first as a pianist and now as a percussionist. Growing up, playing music has always served as an outlet for me, and during high school, 
                        I had the opportunity to meet and perform with numerous other very passionate musicians through ensembles, such as the Missouri All-State Band (2019, 2021) and Missouri All-State Orchestra (2020),
                        during which I performed as a marimba soloist. Beyond these state-wide ensembles, I had the privilege of holding the principal position in the St. Louis All-Suburban Band from 2018-2021 as well
                        as serving as a member of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra (SLSYO) after having my audition recording reviewed by members of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.
                        
                        Beyond these ensemble experiences, I also love the opportunity to perform solo works, especially on marimba and timpani. Through the Mid-Missouri Percussion Arts Trophy (MMPAT) competition,
                        I was able to receive masterclasses from renowned percussionists from around the world, such as Gwendolyn Dease, Svet Stoyanov, and James Doyle, after placing second place for the Solo Marimba,
                        Solo Timpani, and Duet categories.</p>

                    <p>Other memorable ensemble experiences have included the opporunities to perform with the St. Charles Community College Choir, the Indiana University Summer Percussion Academy Ensemble, and the Interlochen Summer Percussion Institute Ensemble.
                        Throughout high school, I was also a member of my school's Symphonic Band, which was selected to perform at the Missouri Music Educators Association (MMEA) Conference in 2019, and I served as the Section Leader for the Percussion
                        Ensemble.</p>

                    <p>I would like to thank my family and teachers, including Michael Faris, Erin Elstner, Alan Stewart, Kevin Gianino, Matt Henry, Aaron Lehde, Jason Harris, Scott Harris, Betsy Cytron, and Katie Solomon, for their continued support throughout the years and for allowing me to grow not only as a musician but also as a young man.</p>

                    <p>I began playing the piano at age 6, and I competed in regional and state-wide competitions from 2012-2018 as both a soloist and as part of a duet. Although I chose
                        to focus my efforts on percussion at the start of my sophomore year of high school, I still find a lot of joy from playing the piano in my sparetime, especially
                        in attempts to recreate whichever song is currently stuck in my head.
