                        <h2>DECA</h2>

                        <p>I joined my school's DECA chapter in August of 2018. Through my involvement with DECA, I have developed strong teamwork and verbal communication skills by working with a partner to present case studies. Additionally, I have spent numerous hours outside of the classroom researching and studying common marketing functions and processes in preparation for the Marketing Cluster Exam.</p>

                        <p>My efforts have allowed me to achieve 2nd place in the Travel and Tourism Team Decision Making event at the 2019 St. Louis District DECA competition and 3rd place in Buying and Merchandising Team Decision Making at the 2020 St. Louis District DECA competition. Furthermore, in 2020, I earned the highest individual Cluster Exam score out of nearly 100 district competitors from Ladue. While COVID-19 resulted in the cancellation of the 2020 Missouri DECA and International DECA competitions, I have been a Missouri DECA State competition qualifier in both 2019 and 2020, placing in the top 10 for my event in 2019.</p>

                        <p>I was inducted into National Honor Society in 2019, my first year of eligibility, based on my leadership, community service, and teacher recommendations. Since joining, I have volunteered around the community, from the Jewish Community Center to the Ladue Early Childhood Center to helping setup my school's second ever winter formal. In addition, I have attended each of my school's monthly meetings held to discuss future opportunities.</p>

                        <p>In addition, I have taken the National Spanish Exam every year since entering high school, receiving the Bronze Medal in both 2018 and 2019, while earning ? in 2020.</p>

                        <h2>Ladue Mayor's Youth Council</h2>

                        <p>I applied to be part of the Ladue Mayor's Youth Council in June of 2019 because I felt there existed a disconnect between the local youth and the city government. In addition, I felt a desire to not only represent the voices of high school students at Ladue Horton Watkins but also of today's youth in general. Since joining the Youth Council, I have worked directly with Ladue Mayor Nancy Spewak to tackle issues ranging from the "Lock it or Leave it" campaign aimed at raising local awareness about the outbreak of stolen cars in the area to the City of Ladue's next Comprehensive Plan to initiatives aimed at increasing community interaction through recycling efforts and community-wide parades.</p>

                        <p>I have helped directly in the planning of the City of Ladue's next Comprehensive Plan, giving input from a youth perspective as to what the overall vision and goals should be for the next decade and a half. However, our most important development has been creating the Ladue Student Opportunities Network. This network has directly connected local businesses to the community's youth through internship opportunities, stimulating small business while also providing crucial career experience for those interested. In addition to actively promoting the Ladue Student Opportunities Network through social media, I directly proposed and implemented the Standardized Test Tutoring program, creating a free ACT, SAT, and PSAT tutoring service for other local high school students during the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

                        <p>I began Future Problem Solving in late 2013, continuing until 2015. During that time, I collaborated with team members to analyze futuristic scenarios, identify potential challenges, and propose action plans to address the underlying issues.</p>

                        <p>Both teams I was apart of achieved great success, earning 1st place in the State Competition for our age group in 2014 and 2015 and going on to compete at the International Competition. Individually, I partook in the Scenario Writing State Competition, a creative writing contest centered around futuristic conflicts, achieving 3rd place in 2014 and 2nd place in 2015.</p>

                        <p>I was first made aware of the World Pediatric Project through my involvement with my school's Spanish Honor Society. Since then, I have volunteered numerous times both through the World Pediatric Project's Ronald McDonald House as well as events such as their "Rock 'n' Heal" fundraiser. Each of the kids have to deal with serious hardship, with many having had to leave their native countries in order to receive crucial surgeries in the United States.</p>

                        <p>I have been able to make special bonds with several of the kids there, including one young boy named Jadiel. Jadiel had to leave his home in the Carribeans to receive treatment for his malformed legs. Fortunately, for several hours each week, I was able to distract Jadiel from his physical ailment through games of Mario Kart, Monopoly, and paper airplane contests.</p>
