                        <h2>Ladue Mayor's Youth Council</h2>

                        <p>I applied to be part of the Ladue Mayor's Youth Council in June of 2019 because I felt there existed a
                            disconnect between the local youth and the city government. In addition, I felt a desire to not only
                            represent the voices of high school students at Ladue Horton Watkins but also of today's youth in general.
                            During my time as part of the Youth Council, I worked directly with Ladue Mayor Nancy Spewak to tackle a variety
                            of issues and challenges facing our community. Our campaigns included a "Lock it or Leave it" awareness initiative
                            aimed at raising local awareness about the outbreak of stolen cars in the area, multiple blood drives and
                            food drives to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on community members, and increased efforts at combatting
                            environmental degradation, such as by raising awareness on proper recycling/composting and by cutting
                            down invasive honeysuckle in local parks.
                            </p>

                        <p>I was also able to directly help in the planning of the City of Ladue's next 15-year Comprehensive Plan, giving
                            input from a youth perspective as to what long-term objectives should help guide city planning in the coming years.
                            An issue we identified was how to stimulate residents' interest in shopping and eating at local businesses
                            rather than flocking to bigger-name restaurants and stores in neighboring cities, and we were able to actionize
                            our ideas into creating the Ladue Student Opportunities Network. This network has become a platform serving to
                            directly connect student job/internship opportunities at the local businesses with the community's high school
                            youth looking for summer opportunities, providing these small businesses with greater exposure while also giving
                            interested students access to crucial career experience.</p>

                        <h2>World Pediatric Project</h2>

                        <p>I first became involved with the World Pediatric Project (WPP) through my school's chapter of Spanish Honor Society in Spring 2018. After
                            learning about the organization's goal to provide children with debilitating injuries an opportunity to come to the United States
                            and receive the necessary surgery at no cost, I became committed to helping the kids recovering at the WPP's Ronald McDonald House
                            in any way I could. Whether it was helping to raise money during the annual "Rock 'n' Heal" fundraiser, communicating with the children's
                            parents in Spanish, or simply teaching the kids how to make paper airplanes, the experience definitely made me grateful to be able to be
                            part of these kids' journeys, each of whom were more resilient and optimistic than anyone I had ever met.</p>

                        <h2>Crown Center for Senior Living</h2>

                        <p>I began volunteering at the local Crown Center in the summer of 2017 after my grandparents, who had been staying with us
                            for several years, went back to China. I was incredibly fortunate to get to help with the center's seniors' dinner services
                            and technology troubles as the conversations also helped me fill the void left by my grandparents' return to China.</p>

                        <p>I was named Volunteer of the Month and accumulated over 60 volunteer hours during the course of a year.</p>

                        <p>The summer before my freshman year of high school, I was offered the position to serve as a 
                            camp counselor for our district's summer camp, Kids Camp Ladue. Getting the chance to guide
                            the Fourth Graders through their daily activities and seeing their endless enthusiasm made me
                            realize how impactful mentors can be in any setting, and it has inspired me towards becoming
                            a TA at Brown.</p>
