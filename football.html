                        <h1>Team Success</h1>

                        <p>My first organized football came in 2015 when I joined the Ladue Middle School team. I immediately became a full time offensive starter and eventually in eighth grade, a full time defensive starter as well. Our team was very successful, ending the two years with back to back 9-0 seasons. As a freshman, I played started on both the Freshmen and JV teams and also played limited snaps on Varsity. The Freshmen and JV teams combined for a 7-2 record while Varsity went on to play in the State Championship, finishing that game with a loss but finished the year 12-2. During my sophomore season, I was slotted to split time between JV starter and rotating Varsity player, but I went down with a torn PCL after the first game of the year. I returned to a limited role during the playoffs as our team eventually went on to win the State Championship for the first time in school history, capping the year off 15-0. Finally as a junior, I earned a full-time starting role on Varsity as the right guard. Our team once again made it to the State Semi-Final match, but fell short, ending the season 12-2.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, my middle school team won two regional championships. My high school teams have won three district championships, two State Semi-Final matches, and one state championship in Class 4 of Missouri Football.</p>
