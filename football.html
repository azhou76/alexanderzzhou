                        <p>Competing in Missouri's Class 4 and Class 5, my high school football team made three state semifinal appearances (2017, 2018, 2019), made two state championship appearances (2017, 2018),
                            and were state champions in 2018, ultimately finishing with a 40-9 record during the four years.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Personal Accolades</h1>

                        <p>I played both Right Guard and Center on the Offensive Line during my four-year varsity career, being named Varsity Captain in 2020.</p>

                        <p>My performance during my junior and senior seasons allowed me to be named a Missouri All-District Team Selection (2020) and a
                            St. Louis Suburban Central Conference 2nd Team Selection (2019, 2020), as voted on by district and conference-wide coaches.
                            In addition, for my strong academic and athletic achievements, I was named to the 2019 Academic All-State Team.</p>

                        <p>I would like to thank my family and coaches, including Mike Tarpey, David Bryant, Quincy Davis, and more, who instilled the work ethic needed to
                            be a successful football player despite being undersized.
                        </p>
