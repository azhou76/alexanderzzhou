                    <h1>Hi, thank you for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>My name is Alex Zhou. I am 19 years old and am a sophomore at Brown University this 2022-2023 school year. At Brown, I plan on earning my degree in Computer Science, Economics, and Applied Math.</p>

                    <p>Here on my website, you will find more information regarding the activities I am most passionate about outside of the classroom as well as the CS projects I've completed through my couses. I grew up in St. Louis, MO, 
                        graduating from Ladue Horton Watkins High School in 2021.
                        My involvement with different organizations, ranging from my high school's football team to regional music ensembles to community-based volunteer programs, all had a huge influence on my life leading up to college.</p>

                    <p>I am excited to continue growing my experiences throughout my remaining years at Brown and as I begin my career post-graduation.</p>

                    <p>Fun Fact: as you might be able to tell from some of the photos and videos, I lost 95 pounds from January 2021 to March 2022 after finishing my high school football career!</p>
